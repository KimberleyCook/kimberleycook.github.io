title: Berlin so far
---

I have been in Berlin for 7 weeks, it has gone ridiculously quick and I have loved *almost* every moment. I remember someone saying before I left the UK that I would learn more about UK culture once I'd gone. I didn't quiet fully understand what they meant at the time, but now I do.

Firstly, us Brits speak far too much. Coming from me, yes. Rather then just getting to the point of what it is we want we dilly daddle around the actual point. Germans are great at saying what they want, they're not rude they just don't waste time. This I like a lot.

Secondly, the UK has GREAT payment systems. We take for granted that we do not have to carry money on us, we can even tap our cards on machines. It's bloody wonderful. We can EVEN forget our card and still get by in the day as Apple Pay made that possible. When you're somewhere that people will look at you funny if you ask to pay for card, you take it for granted. Making sure I always have cash on me is an extremely hard habit to try and break. Particularly when I hate carrying cash.

And lastly, public bike stations are bloody great and have changed my life. I was never a fan of them in London. Maybe because I had my own bike, that was admittedly better. I also, really horrible, use to look down my nose at people on them and think bloody amateurs. Which was really bad. I made this assumption about people without knowing them at all. I have used them several times in Berlin to get somewhere - normally it is quicker, it is exercise and cheaper. Yes, a normal U-Bahn trip in Berlin will cost you $2.70 each way, the bikes are $1 for every half an hour that you use them. Also I have always been a fan of cycling in cities as you get to see it in a way you never would when you're underground on a train. PLlus, cycling around a city at night has always one of my favourite things.
