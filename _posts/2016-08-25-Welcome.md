So I quit my job to travel the world. I've read that's how all nomad blogs should start right? Well I did and this blog will be all about my experiences working on the road. From reflections on how things are going (both good & bad) to what I get up to in the cities I'm visiting.

I decided a few months ago that I could travel the world whilst working. I was sat at my desk in London, in a team of 6, where we mostly communicated via Slack. Seriously we all sat together talking on Slack instead of in person. I'm not saying this is a bad thing it's just how it was. It dawned on me then that I could be doing the exact same thing somewhere else. I also knew that I had nothing holding me back. I don't own a house/dog/car/fish and I don't have children so what was stopping me. Seriously the hardest thing to sort out was my bike, and that I simply gave to a friend.   

So I packed up some clothes into a backpack* and set off for my first destination, Berlin.

* p.s I will do another post detailing more how I minimised my possesions at a later date.
