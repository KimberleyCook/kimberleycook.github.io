title: Berlin > Dresden > Prague
---

During our time in Berlin there was one place we wanted to visit but never got round to it, Dresden. A small city 120 miles south of Berlin.

We could've got the 2 hour train to Prague from Berlin but why do that when you can stop overnight in Dresden and get a 5 hour steamboat journey down the River Elbe. So we did, on this beauty.

Oh and to add to the boat adventure we decided to spend our night in Dresden on a boat too.
