After 18 months of travelling light I've learnt a thing or two, in this post I'm going to focus on a few travel hacks I've learnt along the way.

**1) Packing cubes**

If there's only one hack you take from this post it's this one. Packing cubes, they squash down clothes meaning you can take more with you. Win! I would seriously not be able to travel without them. I use these [Eagle Creek](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Eagle-Creek-Pack-Cube-Black/dp/B00F9S85CS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1509475368&sr=8-1&keywords=eagle+creek+packing+cube) ones, and normally take 2 regular size ones, a small one and a long thin one. These all fit perfectly into my backpack. I have also tried the Amazon own brand ones but didn't think the quality was as good.

**2) Foldable water bottle**

I did not get my first foldable water bottle till 7 months into my travelling and now I have two. One for everyday use, then a separate one in my snowboard bag with a cable attached for snowboarding. There are many reason why a foldable water is a must: 1) The environment, you're not buying plastic bottles which we all know are not good. 2) You save money not buy plastic bottles. 3) As you drink it, it gets smaller in size. And 4) if you ever happen to stay on a boat and there are not glasses by the sink and all the shops are shut, you'll find yourself slurping water from the tap. True fact, this happened to Adam and I in Dresden. This way you'll always have something on you to put water in. I use these clear [1L Platypus](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Platypus-Soft-Push-Pull-Bottle-Waves/dp/B0198Q2090/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1509564920&sr=8-1&keywords=platypus%2Bwater%2Bbottle&th=1) ones, I have used this [Vapur](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Vapur-Element-Reusable-Water-Bottle/dp/B007UU6JI0/ref=sr_1_2?s=sports&ie=UTF8&qid=1509564963&sr=1-2&keywords=vapur+water+bottle) one before but it didn't like the cold, so on a cold morning trail run in Chamonix I found water trickling down my leg.

**3) Squeezy toiletry bottles**

I know some digital nomads buy new toiletries whenever they move to a new location, but sometimes Adam and I can move every month so this would not be financially worth it. Therefore one thing we always try to do is buy squeezy products that get smaller as you use them. This saves us a ton of space and means we don't waste money buying new products every destination.

**4) Free samples**

Whenever I'm offered a free sample I always take them. They take up barely any space, and when you're moving between locations and have one/two nights somewhere they come in super handy. Plus it's a great way of trying out new products.
