title: Exploring Abandoned Berlin
---

One of my favourite things about Berlin is it's history. Yes Berlin has many museums, and is very well known for it's clubbing reputation, but one of the things that intrigues me the most is the abandoned buildings that you'll find hidden around the city.  

When I visited last summer I got a taste for it when visiting Tempelhof. An airport abandoned in 2008, that was built by the Nazi's in the mid 1930's. You are unable to go inside but you can cycle around the [airfield](https://www.instagram.com/p/7DuIW9q-Be/?taken-by=kimberleycook). After reading up more about abandoned place after leaving Berlin I knew that next I visited I had to visit a few.


### Spreepark

Spreekpark was an entertainment park in the Berlin district of Treptow, formally part of the GDR-controlled West Berlin when the wall was up. It opened in 1969, and was the only park of it's kind in either East or West Berlin. However in 2002 it closed it's door as the family running it got into extreme debt.

First thing you should know is that as of 2014 all tours of the park were stopped due to an arson attack so if I wanted to go in I knew I'd have to sneak/break in. I read up a little online beforehand about people climbing over or under the fences. Many said this was doable but be careful of the guard on patrol, and beware of any dogs that the guards will have with them. This didn't phase us that much so we got up bright and early on a Sunday ready to sneak in.

We got there and walked around the outside of the park looking for somewhere to sneak in. This was a terrible idea as we managed to talk ourselves out of going in. Partly because there were signs all around saying "Do not enter. Danger of life and limb" and partly because I am a massive wimp who doesn't like being told off. So nope we weren't going in, we (mainly me) chickened out.

Till, we met Astrid. A travel blogger who (cleverly) hadn't read much online and didn't give a crap about the guards or rumoured dogs. She asked if we were sneaking in too and said did we all want to explore together. Adam and I mumbled a little, and without hesitation she said "I am jumping over, I'll wait 5 minutes for you in that bush after then I'm leaving." And under the fence she went. Adam and I looked at each other, smiled and over we went.

As I was jumping over my heart was beating so bloody fast. I don't remember much except throwing my bag over, me jumping over, then running as fast as I could into the bushes. We started to slowly wander around and within 5 minutes saw a guard. There the 3 of us were, hiding in some bushes next to the abandoned bumper cars. I cannot tell you the last time I felt scared of getting told off by someone. Looking back now it's hilarious, but at the time I was petrified.

Once we'd waited 5 minutes till the guard had gone we continued exploring.

We spent 2.5 hours in the park and it is the best thing I have done in Berlin so I am so glad we met Astrid. Sometimes you simply need someone to tell you stop being a fool and have fun.

### Teufelsberg

Up next was Teufelsberg, a man-made hill that covers a Nazi military-technical college. And on top of this hill sits a former US listening station. This story does not have as much drama as the previous one because in the late 90's a group of investors bought the former listening station area from the City of Berlin with the intention to build hotels and apartments. That didn't happen. Instead they charge tourists &euro;7 to get in and look around. Don't get me wrong this old spy tower was still incredible to look around but did not have the fear factor of Spreepark.

The first thing I noticed when I started walking around was the graffiti.

One of the my favourite things about this place was that you could see people use the space now to party. With glass bottles scattered everywhere. Even a beer can bin.

A hole in the wall that DEFINITELY looks like a DJ booth.

Now onto the Spy Tower. My favourite thing about this place was that you could only get to the spy tower via a pitch black concrete staircase with signs like this.

See a spy tower! Hi Berlin.

Visiting these 2 places was hugely inspired by finding this site, [Abandoned Berlin](http://www.abandonedberlin.com/), which I highly recommend looking through. (If abandoned creepy shit is your thing of course). One of the things I did not time to explore was this [abandoned hospital](http://www.abandonedberlin.com/2015/06/koenigin-elisabeth-hospital.html). Always next time :)
