Whistler is known all around the world for its world class skiing and snowboarding. It is the largest ski resort in North America, but what happens when the snow starts to melt?

If you've read my post on [exploring abandonded Berlin](http://travel.builtby.kim/exploring-abandoned-berlin/) you'll know it's something I enjoy doing.

The crash occurred in 1956, due to a mistake made on the weight of the train and it going 35mph in a 15mpg zone. There was a derailment, causing the back 4 carriages to derail. If you go there you may think, why are none of the surrounding tress damaged? That is because where the boxcars are now is not where the crash happened, they were moved there shorly after.

To get to the Whistler Train Wreck, follow the trail at the side of Jane Lakes Road past the Sea To Sky Trail sign and into the forest. The majority of the trail to the Whistler Train Wreck site is easy, with a very short steep downhill near the suspension bridge.

After crossing the bridge, walk up the hill and you're in the middle of the train wreck site, with boxcars on both sides of you. Do take your time walking around and checking out the wreck.

Over time the train wreck site was transformed into a unique work of art and a bike park. Yes a bike park! On the next picture spot the bike ramp on top of the boxcar.

When wandering around the wreck do consider climbing onto the boxcars if you dare.

One thing I will mention is that if you walk the trail in the spring or summer just remember that you are in someone else's home, so be safe.

This is one of those hidden gems that I absolutely love finding whilst travelling, so if you're in Whistler and want to do something that is off the beaten track _get it badum tish_ then I seriously recommend this.
