title: Team dynamic when remote working
---

As a follow up to my [remote working](http://travel.builtby.kim/remote-working/) post I thought I'd write a post discussing a few things I think teams to improve the experience if they have remote members.

**Meetings**

If you have a meeting and several of your team members are remote, make sure everyone goes on their own computers and dials into a video call. As soon as you have a few team members sat next to each other there will be an instant disadvantage for those dialling in. Those people sat together will be able to talk easier, and much quicker. They may even start talking together, and then those dialling in will not be able to hear what is being said. Whereas if all team members are dialling in, you'll have a mutual understanding to leave that split second before speaking and not overtalking each other. This puts all team members on the same playing field.

**Stand ups**

If as a team you have a daily face-to-face stand up, and one of your team members is remote, take that little bit of time and effort to dial them in. You'll be surprised what bits of information may be included in those few minutes that the person not included may miss. I've been in a situation before where I wasn't included in those daily face-to-face stand ups and I missed a vitle bit of information that resulted in me spenting 2 hours trying to set up a project from a bitbucket repository when in fact the company had moved to GitHub.

**Tasks**

Depending on what system you use to keep track of tasks, be it Trello or Jira, always always make sure the acceptance criteria on the tickets are correct. If something in that criteria changes make sure to update the ticket information as soon as possible. You don't want your team member working on a feature that is no longer correct. More so important if a member of your team is in a different timezone and you don't always get that crossover.

**Documentation**

Do you have coding standards that members of the team should follow? Does the team have a particular review process for pull requests? If there are work flows, or structures that members of your team should follow have all of this documented very clearly somewhere. Actually whether team members are remote or not, documenting this is important for new members of the team too.

**Face to face calls**

One thing that you can miss out on when working remote is the face-to-face communication, rather than spending time typing out something over Slack have a quick call. If you were in the office and wanted to rubber duck with someone else for a few minutes you would ask them. And this can be done with remote working too. Having that face-to-face quick call can save both of you so mcuh time as you don't need to spent time typing. Also it's always nice to have a quick face call to keep in touch with the world.

Now did you notice anything about all of the points...they are all about **communication.** This is fundamentally the most important thing when teams are remote. I truly believe that if your communicaton as a team is not good, working remote will not be an enjoyable experience for anyone.
